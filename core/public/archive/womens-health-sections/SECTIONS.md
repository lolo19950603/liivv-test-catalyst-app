# Women's Health & Wellness page sections

Visual reference: [`../womens-health-wellness.html`](../womens-health-wellness.html) — open it in a browser beside the Makeswift editor and build the sections in order. Every section in the HTML has a dark pill badge naming the Makeswift component to use.

This HTML is a **content + composition guide** (section order, copy, CTAs). It is not a pixel-perfect preview of Makeswift components — build visuals in the Makeswift editor using the real Health / Specialized / Home components listed below.

No new components are needed — everything below already exists in the picker.

**Suggested page path:** `/pages/womens-health-wellness`  
**Page story:** *Every chapter of you* — women's wellness products, tips, pharmacist care, and life chapters. Clair is **one equal feature** in the lineup (section 8), with **Learn more** linking to the dedicated Clair page — not the focus of this page.  
**Voice:** warm, modern, confident. Prefer: rhythm, glow, balance, ease, comfort, chapters, tips.  
**Palette:** cream `#f5f2ed` / sage `#8ea78b` / blush `#f3c7be` / charcoal `rgb(49,47,47)` — keep component defaults, they already match.

**Related pages:**
- [`../clair-health.html`](../clair-health.html) — Clair product deep-dive + pre-order (`/pages/clair-health`)
- Life-stage chapters (section 9 **Learn more**):
  - [`../foundation-first-cycles.html`](../foundation-first-cycles.html) — Foundation & First Cycles (10–18)
  - [`../rhythm-and-balance.html`](../rhythm-and-balance.html) — Rhythm & Balance (18–30)
  - [`../reset-and-recharge.html`](../reset-and-recharge.html) — Reset & Recharge (30s+)
  - [`../grow-and-recover.html`](../grow-and-recover.html) — Grow & Recover
  - [`../transition-and-relief.html`](../transition-and-relief.html) — Transition & Relief
  - [`../longevity-and-vitality.html`](../longevity-and-vitality.html) — Longevity & Vitality

## Build checklist

1. Create the page in Makeswift at `/pages/womens-health-wellness`.
2. Open `womens-health-wellness.html` beside the editor.
3. Drop components in order; paste copy from this file.
4. Suffixes: `women` (most), `tips` (section 7).
5. Wire section 8 **Learn more** → `/pages/clair-health`.
6. Wire section 9 panel **Learn more** links → the six life-stage pages.
7. Build each stage page from [`STAGES.md`](STAGES.md) + its HTML mock.

## Copy guardrails

- This page is a **Women's Health destination** — products, tips, chapters, pharmacist care.
- Clair is **one equal feature**; deep product education and pre-order live on the Clair page.
- Never use: symptoms, treatment, patients, medical-grade, diagnosis, invented clearance/accuracy claims.
- Lean on: rhythm, chapter, season, comfort, glow, balance, ease, soft, kind, tips.
- Clinical claims always carry `Available in Ontario` or "In Ontario."
